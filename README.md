# DiscoAnalytica

## Introduction
**DiscoAnalytica** is a collaborative music analysis project that combines **data science, music theory, and computational analysis** to uncover insights into musical structures, genres, and patterns. This project is designed for researchers, musicians, and data enthusiasts who want to explore the relationships between rhythm, melody, harmony, and other musical elements using modern computational tools.

## Why "DiscoAnalytica"?
The name **DiscoAnalytica** is a fusion of:
- **DiscothÃ¨que** â€“ referencing the historical role of dance clubs in shaping musical trends and the study of recorded music.
- **Analytica** â€“ derived from the Greek *analytikos* (á¼€Î½Î±Î»Ï…Ï„Î¹ÎºÏŒÏ‚), meaning "skilled in analysis" or "systematic examination."

Together, **DiscoAnalytica** represents the **systematic study of music, rhythm, and sound through computational analysis.**

## Features
- **Musical Feature Extraction**: Analyze harmony, melody, rhythm, and spectral properties of audio.
- **Statistical Correlation Studies**: Discover relationships between musical elements and genres.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Lyrics Analysis**: Use NLP models like **spaCy** to analyze lyrical content.
- **Spectral & Temporal Analysis**: Utilize **Astral UV** for signal processing and spectral data analysis.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Implement ML models to categorize and predict musical characteristics.
- **Collaborative & Extensible**: Built to support contributions from the music and data science communities.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/DiscoAnalytica.git
cd DiscoAnalytica
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment
It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
# On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
Install the required packages using `pip`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install:
- **spaCy** (for natural language processing of lyrics)
- **Astral UV** (for spectral analysis)
- **NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib** (for data handling and visualization)
- **Scikit-learn** (for machine learning models)

Additionally, download the necessary **spaCy** language model:
```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

### 4. Verify Installation
To check if everything is installed correctly, run the following test:
```bash
python -c "import spacy; nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm'); print('spaCy is working!')"
```
