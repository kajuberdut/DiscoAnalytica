# DiscoAnalytica

## Introduction
**DiscoAnalytica** is a collaborative music analysis project that combines **data science, music trends, and computational analysis** to uncover insights into lyrical sentiment, genre popularity, and other non-technical musical elements. This project is designed for researchers, music enthusiasts, and data scientists who want to explore the relationships between lyrical themes, cultural trends, and societal metrics using modern computational tools.

## Why "DiscoAnalytica"?
The name **DiscoAnalytica** is a fusion of:
- **DiscothÃ¨que** â€“ referencing the historical role of dance clubs in shaping musical trends and the study of recorded music.
- **Analytica** â€“ derived from the Greek *analytikos* (á¼€Î½Î±Î»Ï…Ï„Î¹ÎºÏŒÏ‚), meaning "skilled in analysis" or "systematic examination."

Together, **DiscoAnalytica** represents the **systematic study of music trends, sentiment, and cultural impact through computational analysis.**

## Features
- **Lyrical Sentiment Analysis**: Examine how emotional tone in lyrics changes over time.
- **Statistical Correlation Studies**: Discover relationships between genre popularity and cultural/societal trends.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Lyrics Analysis**: Use NLP models like **spaCy** to analyze lyrical content.
- **Exploring Trends in Music**: Analyze trends such as **changing sentiment, lyrical complexity, and grade level**, and compare these trends to broader societal metrics like **educational attainment levels or average household income.**
- **Collaborative & Extensible**: Built to support contributions from the music and data science communities.
